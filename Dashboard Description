Key Insights from the Dashboard

1).Total Cost vs. Reimbursement (Bar Chart)

Objective: Highlights the difference between total drug cost and reimbursement.

Findings: Reimbursement amounts are significantly lower than total costs, indicating that Medicaid bears a higher financial burden.

Implication: Policy adjustments may be required to contain costs and ensure reimbursement aligns with actual expenses.

2).Top 10 Drugs with the Highest Cost Variance (Bar Chart)

Objective: Identifies drugs where costs exceed reimbursement amounts.

Findings: Certain drugs have a high variance, meaning Medicaid is paying significantly more out-of-pocket.

Implication: This could indicate inefficiencies in drug pricing, potential fraud, or a need for renegotiating contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers.

3).Potential Savings by Switching to Generics (Pie Chart)

Objective: Displays cost-saving opportunities by preferring generic drugs over brand-name equivalents.

Findings: Significant cost reductions are possible by shifting to generics, which provide the same therapeutic benefits at a lower price.

Implication: Encouraging the use of generics could reduce Medicaid expenditures and improve budget efficiency.

4).Total Cost Trend Over Time (Line Chart)

Objective: Analyzes prescription drug cost trends over the years.

Findings: A decline in total costs from 2023 to 2024, potentially due to policy changes, increased use of generics, negotiation of drug prices, or fewer approved claims.

Implication: Forecasting for 2025 is necessary to ensure cost trends remain stable and cost-saving measures are maintained.

5).Forecasted Healthcare Costs & Savings (2023-2025) (Multi-line Chart)

Objective: Predicts total cost, reimbursements, and potential savings for 2025.

Findings: An increase in projected savings suggests that cost-management strategies, such as preferring generics, are proving effective.

Implication: If total costs continue to rise, Medicaid may need to implement additional cost-control measures or adjust funding allocations.

Business Problem and Solution

Problem Statement

Medicaid is experiencing high prescription drug costs, with a significant variance between total expenses and reimbursement.
Certain drugs have disproportionately high costs that could be reduced through strategic interventions.
Proposed Solution

Identified high-cost drugs that contribute to increased Medicaid expenditures.

Analyzed cost variance to detect inefficiencies in pricing and reimbursement.

Quantified potential savings through a transition to generic alternatives.

Developed data-driven recommendations for Medicaid to:

Renegotiate rebate agreements

Adjust reimbursement policies

Optimize formulary design

Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL (BigQuery) – Query Medicaid claims data and aggregate cost analysis.
Excel (PivotTables, Formulas, Forecasting) – Perform cost variance calculations and trend analysis.
Conclusion

This analysis provides actionable insights into prescription drug expenditures and potential cost-saving opportunities. By leveraging data analysis techniques, Medicaid and other healthcare organizations can make informed decisions regarding formulary design, rebate negotiations, and cost control strategies.
